                Chestertown Builders, Inc. was founded in 2000, by Alden Yetman, a fourth generation builder, born and raised in
                Kent County, Maryland. After diverse building experiences in North Carolina and Colorado, Alden returned home to
                the Eastern Shore. Chestertown Builders was established based on Aldenâ€™s experiences, convinced that loyal
                relationships and honest business practices are not only rare, but just as important to a reputable construction
                business as top quality materials.
            </p>

            <p>
                Chestertown Builders strives to stay progressive in an ever-changing building industry. While respecting
                tradition and the work ethic of previous generations, we are always looking forward to opportunities to shape
                the future of our trade. We provide services from preliminary design work to finished product for any type of
                building concept. Projects range from small remodels to large custom homes, including limited commercial
                construction.
            </p>

            <p>
                We maintain long standing relationships with the most skilled trade professionals in the area. Our company is
                structured to keep open communication between all employees and contractors involved on a project. Our employees
                and contractors begin a project knowing that, when complete, our customer will be satisfied, and new friendships
                made.
